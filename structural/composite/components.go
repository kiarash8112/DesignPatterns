/*
Weâ€™re building an application for an incident management organization. When
an incident (eg fire) occurs, one or more teams may be deployed to attack the
incident.
A team often includes a truck and one or more human resources. It can also
include a sub team. For example, for a medium-sized incident, we may need
to deploy two teams and each team may contain a truck and two persons.
- Team
- Sub Team 1
- Truck
- Human Resource
- Human Resource
- Sub Team 2
- Truck
- Human Resource
- Human Resource
Look at the current implementation of our application in the
composite package.
What are the problems with this implementation? Refactor the code
using the composite pattern.
